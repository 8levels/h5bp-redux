# HTML5 Boilerplate UI

The H5BP UI project is a lightweight, template-based HTML/CSS/JS toolkit.

H5BP UI is made up of flexible UI templates that can be used to rapidly build common web components.

Each part of the project attempts to provide a degree of separation between structure and theme, making it easier to customise the default theme while retaining the robust structural underpinnings.

The project is currently at a *very* early stage of development.

## Getting involved

### H5BP UI coding conventions

Please follow these coding conventions when submitting pull requests:

* 4 space indentation.
* Make changes to the `.scss` files, **not** `.css`.
* Write multi-line CSS/SCSS.
* Compile all SCSS to CSS by running `./watch.sh` in the project directory.
* Include semicolons at the end of relevant JavaScript statements.
